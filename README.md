## About

Lyrixfy helps you capture the specific part from lyrics and share it as screenshot with others. The project is inspired by Spotify mobile version but this one has more features and huge customization.

## Design

The application's UI is minimal, clean, and intuitive, which was one of my goals to achieve. The logo and UI were designed by myself. The application supports both dark and light modes.
